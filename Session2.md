# Session 2 - Actual Development: The Practicals

In this tutorial, we will be using the Client-Server Architecture for our application.

With this, let's start the software development process that we are familiar before.

## A brief mention on version control

Version Control Systems had become one of the most crucial develop tools ever since their release. 

## Pre software development process

Remember what we've learnt last week, now it's time to apply them!



## Frontend (React)

- Design principle
- Web interface: How to approach? Framework or Self written?
- Mockup

## Backend (Django with DRF)

### API design

## Testing and Test Driven Development

### Coverage
