1. Idea

## Sharing

Let's do a short sharing on what was learnt during the course from all of you.

## Reminder on Continual Learning

Before we end this mini crash course, I remind all of you once more:

> As a software developer, we must constantly learn and grow ourselves, so that we can adapt our skills in this ever evolving technology environment.

Have fun learning and have fun developing.
