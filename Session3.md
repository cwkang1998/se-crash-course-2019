# Session 3 - Mid Development: Challenges, Deployment and CI/CD

> Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong - *Murphy's Law*

Most often than not, things don't go perfectly during the software development process. Today we will discuss on types of things that go wrong, and how to handle these issues when encountered.

## Challenges

### Radical Requirements Changes

The change of requirements during development could be said to be on of the most common and
Most common among all of the challenges, radical requirements changes is one of the most dreaded challenges that a team frequently faced, especially when dealing with a client that does not know what they want, or someone who have rapidly changing mindset on what they should have in their application.

### Resource Constraints

### Platform Constraints

To enable a better development quality and speed, we may or may not end up relying on a certain platform during the initial development of the project. However, sometimes the project relies too much on the platform, with the platform acting as a critical dependency for the application's operation.

### Environmental Constraints

- Libraries incompatibility

### Technology Constraints

## Virtual Machine

## Continuous Integration & Deployment

### A case study with Gitlab and Heroku

First, let me show you an overview of the entire process.



## Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is often talked about and praised, but what exactly is it?

Well, it does not really mean that the data is on cloud and what not, what it actually is, is essentailly renting server from someone else.

 

## Containerization
